[Error - 11:21:48] 
Failed to load plugin 'import' declared in 'react-superchat/package.json Â» eslint-config-react-app': Cannot find module 'eslint-plugin-import'
Require stack:
- /var/www/html/seb/react-node-superchat/__placeholder__.js
Happened while validating /var/www/html/seb/react-node-superchat/react-superchat/src/components/TopBar/TopBar.js
This can happen for a couple of reasons:
1. The plugin name is spelled incorrectly in an ESLint configuration file (e.g. .eslintrc).
2. If ESLint is installed globally, then make sure 'eslint-plugin-import' is installed globally as well.
3. If ESLint is installed locally, then 'eslint-plugin-import' isn't installed correctly.

Consider running eslint --debug /var/www/html/seb/react-node-superchat/react-superchat/src/components/TopBar/TopBar.js from a terminal to obtain a trace about the configuration files used.
